# Order API Project - Coding Challenge

## Project Brief
- REST API built using the language of your choice, though ideally PHP (again, with the framework of your choice)
- API Functionality:
    - Create an order with the following fields;
      - Id
      - Customer 
        - First name
        - Last name
        - Email address
      - Delivery Postcode
      - Order Description 
      - Price
    - Update this order
    - Read this order - returning the response in JSON

## Set Up Instructions (running locally with Homestead Vagrant VM)

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into directory
2. In your new directory, run `composer install`
3. Run `vendor/bin/homestead make`
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file:
`cp .env.example .env`
5. Update the db, username and password your `.env` file
6. Run `vagrant up`
7. Login to the virtual machine: `vagrant ssh`
8. Navigate to new `code` folder: `cd code`
9. Generate a new artisan key: `art key:generate`
10. Run the database migration: `art migrate`

Visit `http://homestead.test` on Mac or `http://localhost:8000` on Windows

## Testing

There is a series of Unit Tests that can be run on the Vagrant machine:
`art test --testsuite Unit`

The files are located at:
`tests/Unit/`

## API Documentation

### Base URL
`https://ordersapi.test/api/`

### Orders

### `POST /orders`

Will create a new order in the database

#### Request

```json
{	
    "customer": {
        "first_name": "<first name>", // REQ - String
        "last_name" : "<last name>", // REQ - String
        "email": "<email>", // REQ - String
    },
    "delivery_postcode": "<postcode>", // REQ - String
    "order_description": "<order description>",// REQ - String
    "price": "<price>" // REQ - Float
}
```

### `GET /orders/<id>`

Will return an order with the given `id`.
 
```json
{	
    "id": 1,
    "customer": {
        "first_name": "Bilbo", 
        "last_name" : "Baggins", 
        "email": "bilbo@theshire.net", 
    },
    "delivery_postcode": "BS1 9DP", 
    "order_description": "2 barrels of wine",
    "price": "1.99"
}
```

### `PUT /orders/<id>`

Will update an existing order. 

#### Request

Use the same request format as `POST /order`.

## DB Structure

### Customers
#### Columns
- id - int - autogenerated
- first_name - str
- last_name - str
- email - str
- timestamps - time

### Orders
#### Columns
- id - int - autogenerated
- customer_id - int- foriegn key customers.id
- delivery_postcode - str
- order_description - str
- price - float


### Next steps
- [x] Update store controller to use elloqent to associate order/customer rather than using the ID
- [x] Create Response class to format the reponse correctly, tests for this as well
- [x] Check for existing customer and don't create duplicate if one already exists
  - [x] BUG - 
            "message": "Call to undefined method Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Builder::orders()",
                "exception": "BadMethodCallException",
                "file": "/home/vagrant/code/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Support/Traits/ForwardsCalls.php",
                "line": 50,
- [x] PUT route
- [x] GET route

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
